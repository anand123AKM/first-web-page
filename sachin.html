Because of that inning, people all around the country got to know about a 16 years old kid that bats till the bowlers collapse. The Indian cricket team selectors did not waste time in selecting him and before anyone could have imagined Sachin Tendulkar was selected for the series against Pakistan only at the age of 16.
<br> <br>
On 15 November 1989, Sachin Tendulkar made his international debut against Pakistan in Karachi. Pakistan’s cricket team was known for its bowling during those days where the combo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis were considered to be the most dangerous bowling duo. But Sachin faced them gracefully and even made a few runs. A 16 years old boy was able to face the most feared bowlers of that time which opened the doors for him to be selected for future cricket matches and a chance to represent the Indian National team. Sachin Tendulkar in his autobiography has mentioned that the series against Pakistan was memorable to him as he got a chance to meet and learn to form his idols such as Kapil dev and Sunil Gavaskar.

<br><br>
<b> The Rise of Sachin Tendulkar</b><br>
During the years 1994-1999, Sachin Tendulkar was in his twenties and his performance was at its peak. He opened the batting against New Zealand in 1994 and made 84 runs from just 49 balls, He then went on and scored his first ODI century against Australia. It took him around 78 ODI’s to score his first century but it was worth the wait.

Tendulkar went on and scored an unbeaten 204 runs in the first test and also dismantled the bowling of Shane Warne where he conceded 111 runs to Tendulkar. Australia lost the match to India within three days and it was all because of the exceptional batting that a twenty years old had shown. The bad luck for Australia continued as Tendulkar went on and scored two consecutive centuries. The twin knocks by Sachin Tendulkar are known as the ‘Desert Storm’ as they allowed Tendulkar to show his supremacy to the world.
<br>
Sachin Tendulkar’s performance in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India’s entry into the semifinals in which he scored 141 runs and also took four Australian wickets.

<b>Sachin Tendulkar - The Opener </b><br>
The main contribution of Sachin Tendulkar was the way he changed the opening of cricket.

India started to get a good start in the match because of the opening which Sachin provided. The opposition was always under pressure because of his opening as they had no answers to the world-class batting which Sachin showed in every match. One of the things that made Sachin great was his ability to score against a very good bowling unit. He was consistent in scoring hundreds against teams such as Australia, New Zealand, and England.  He is still the player to have the highest runs against mighty Australia. From 1990 through 2000 Australian cricket teams were considered to be invisible.
