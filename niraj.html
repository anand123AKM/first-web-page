Athletic Career :
<br>
Like many other successful people, Neeraj also took inspiration from his weak point, where his friends teased him due to his obesity in childhood. Because of that, his father admitted him to a gymnasium and then joined a gym in Shivaji stadium of Panipat, where he saw the javelin throwers for the first time and got curious about it.
<br>
Later he started getting training, and for taking up his interest in the Javelin Throw in 2010, he gave the trials for admission in Sports Authority of India center. Luckily, he got recognized by famous javelin thrower Jaiveer Choudhary who decided to give training to Neeraj. Then, he joined other professional javelin throwers in Jalandhar for further training.
<br>
Neeraj won his first medal in a district championship, and for his further practice, he asked his father to permit for living in Panipat.

Beginning of International career <br>
In 2013, Neeraj took part in his first international athletics event held in Ukraine as World Youth Championships.

Journey to Olympic Gold <br>
Neeraj's journey for gold was not so easy and straight as he faced several hurdles that stopped him from participating in Tokyo Olympics 2020. The biggest of all, which was also a hurdle for many other sportspeople, is no outdoors training facilities and permission during the covid-19 pandemic. Still, these problems could not distract Neeraj from his ultimate goal of winning an Olympic Gold Medal.
