    <h1> Rani Lakshmi Bai</h1><br>
    Rani Lakshmi Bai was an unforgettable warrior in the history of India. She is famous as the Rani of Jhansi or as the renowned Queen of Jhansi. Varanasi is the place she belongs to, popularly called Kashi. It was 1857 when the queen showed her heroism and valour, rising with a rebellion against Britishers. This battle was known as the very first war for Independence. Rani Lakshmi Bai died like a hero at the young age of 29 and was amongst the most contributing characters. 
<br>


Formally known as Manikarnika Tambe, Rani Lakhsmi Bai was the brave daughter of Bhagirathi Tambe and Moropant Tambe. She took birth in 1828, Nov 19th, at Kashi. Rani Lakshmi Bai was a Brahmin girl and got her nickname "Manu" when her father moved to Bithoor, a district in Uttar Pradesh. After her mother's death, they moved as Moropant Tambe (Rani Lakshmi Bai's father) worked as an advisor in the court of Peshwa Baji Rao, general and statesman of the Maratha Empire. 

<br><br>
From her childhood days, Manikarnika got all the teaching in martial arts, fencing, horse riding, and shooting. She used to have a good time playing with Rao Sahib, Nana Sahib, Tantia Tope, and other boys who came to Peshwa's court. Rani Lakshmi Bai had a couple of mares as she was good at horse riding. The two mares were named Sarangi and Pavan.

<br><br>
At the age of fourteen, Manu married Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. It was 1842, and he was the emperor of Jhansi. Just after marriage, Queen Jhansi got the name of Lakshmi Bai, as she was Laxmi, the Goddess of money in the Hindu religion. As per Marathasâ€™ customs and tradition, Bai is known as one honorable title to represent the Maharani or Queen. She gave birth to a son in the year 1851, whose name was Damodar
<br>
Rao. Unfortunately, the child died within four months of his birth because of chronic illness.

<br><br>
The British Government took an opportunity over the Maharaja's death, which caused the loss of bloodline heir, and considered occupying Jhansi. Following the incidents, the British East India Company introduced the rule of Doctrine of Lapse. They pointed out that if any princely state comes under any indirect or direct rule of the Company, and the ruler of the state dies without a male legal heir, that is when the East India Company has the right to annex the state. Manikarnika was displeased by this unfairness, and she pleaded in London Court. Quite naturally, since it was the rule already imposed, all her attempts proved futile.
<br><br>

After the petitions went unaccepted by the British Government or the East India Company, war broke out in 1857. It is popularly known as the Mutiny of 1857. The revolt started at Meerut on 10th May. The revolt's original date was set on 31st May 1857, but people were already emotionally charged, restive, and impatient against the Britishers' exploitations. Hence, they started the revolution way before.

The Queen of Jhansi fought with impeccable valour and courage. She single-handedly fought with the British army till one of the English horsemen struck her on the rear head, and another severely wounded her breast. Despite being heavily injured, she continued the fight bravely and killed the horsemen. She fell from the horse and collapsed on the ground. Rani Laksmi Bai will always be remembered amongst the bravest fighters in Indian history.

<br><br>
Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi, was the first woman warrior in Indian history to be this brave and powerful. She gave her life in the struggle for Swaraj and the liberation of India from British domination. Rani Lakshmi Bai is a shining example of patriotism and pride in one's country. For many individuals, she is an inspiration and a source of admiration. Her name will forever be imprinted in golden letters in India's history and in the hearts of all Indians.
